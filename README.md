# Crop-Weed-Detection

This project was actually a part of my internship at **Uniconverge Technologies** which I completed succesfully during my summer vacation. The problem statement is given the crop and weed images along with main principal components that describe the features of the image, we need to detect for weeds in a given crop image which helps in preventing the wastage of pesticides.

The model I have used to solve this problem is YoloV5 CNN which I trained using Roboflow and PyTorch with a dataset of around 1300 images. The complete code is in this repository and the performance of the model is even good.

Happy Learning !! :)
